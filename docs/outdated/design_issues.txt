After a careful review of clangd_graph_rag_updater.py and its related modules, I've identified a few potential issues. The
  overall "mini-index" strategy is clever, but its implementation has a significant blind spot.

  Here are the bugs I've found:
  
Major Bug: Incorrect Handling of Older clangd Index Formats

  The script will fail to correctly update the call graph when using a clangd index file that lacks the Container field
  (i.e., from clangd versions before 21.x). This is due to two related flaws:


   1. Incomplete "Mini-Index" Creation: In Phase 3 (_build_mini_index), the logic to find 1-hop neighbors (callers and callees)
      of the changed symbols relies exclusively on the ref.container_id field. If this field doesn't exist, no neighbors are
      found. The "mini-index" will only contain the symbols from the changed files, but not the symbols from unchanged files
      that call them or are called by them.


   2. Incomplete Span Information for Call Graph Rebuilding: In Phase 4 (_rerun_ingestion_pipeline), when the script detects it
      needs to use ClangdCallGraphExtractorWithoutContainer, it initializes a FunctionSpanProvider with only the list of changed
       files. The extractor needs function spans for all files in the mini-index (including the neighbors from unchanged files)
      to spatially resolve the call graph. Since it only receives spans for the changed files, it cannot create the :CALLS
      relationships between the updated code and any existing, unchanged code.


  Impact: When running an incremental update on a project indexed with an older version of clangd, the updated functions
  will appear isolated in the graph, with their incoming and outgoing calls to the rest of the codebase missing.

  Minor Issue: Inconsistent FunctionSpanProvider Instantiation

  There's a logical inconsistency between Phase 4 and Phase 5.


   * Phase 4 incorrectly gives FunctionSpanProvider a limited list of changed files.
   * Phase 5 correctly initializes FunctionSpanProvider by giving it the entire project path to scan, ensuring it has all the
     spans it needs for its task.


  This inconsistency further highlights the bug in Phase 4. While Phase 5 works correctly, the graph it operates on may
  already be flawed from the incomplete work in Phase 4.

---------------------------

File @code_graph_rag_generator.py now basically has two entry points, one is summarize_code_graph(self), the other is 
  summarize_targeted_update(self, seed_symbol_ids: set). They each have their own sets of function callees hierarchy. Do you 
  think there is some common logic inside the two? Or can we abstract some common logic for the two paths?

I would suggest to refactor the _summarize_targeted_functions by taking out the pass 1 processing to 
  summarize_targeted_update. You plan to keep pass 1 and pass 2 in _summarize_targeted_functions has problems: 1. 
  summarize_targeted_update is not as clear about the passes as summarize_code_graph. 2. It is unclear which ids are handled 
  for codeSummary, although we already know only seed ids need.

   1. Create _summarize_functions_individually_with_ids(self, function_ids: list[str]) for core Pass 1 logic.
   2. Modify summarize_functions_individually() to retrieve all relevant IDs and call this new method.
   3. Create _summarize_functions_with_context_with_ids(self, function_ids: list[str]) for core Pass 2 logic.
   4. Modify summarize_functions_with_context() to retrieve all relevant IDs and call this new method.
   5. Refactor summarize_targeted_update(self, seed_symbol_ids: set) to explicitly call
      _summarize_functions_individually_with_ids with seed_symbol_ids for Pass 1, then expand scope, and call
      _summarize_functions_with_context_with_ids with the expanded scope for Pass 2.
