"""
Main entry point for the code graph ingestion pipeline.

This script orchestrates the different processors to build a complete code graph:
1. Extracts function spans using tree-sitter.
2. Ingests the code's file/folder structure.
3. Ingests symbol definitions (functions, structs, etc.).
4. Ingests the function call graph.
